# How to Add Wiki Articles

To contribute new articles to this wiki:

1. Create a Markdown file in the `docs` directory. Use a short, descriptive file name with dashes or underscores.
2. Add a link to the new file in `docs/README.md` to keep the table of contents up to date.
3. Commit the new file and updated `README.md` in a single pull request.
4. Keep articles concise and use Markdown headings to structure content.
