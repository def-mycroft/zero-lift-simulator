This article lists open questions about the project to clarify next steps and ensure alignment with overall goals.

## Clarifying Goals

1. What are the long-term objectives for extending the simulator beyond the basic lift scenario?
2. Is the current architecture flexible enough to support multiple lifts or more complex agent behavior?

## Implementation Details

3. Are there preferred patterns for handling event scheduling and logging that we should standardize?
4. What performance characteristics are most critical to measure as we expand functionality?
5. Are there any integrations (e.g., with external data sources) planned for future development?

Please provide any additional guidance or documentation that addresses these questions.

This article lists open questions about the project to clarify next steps and ensure alignment with overall goals.

## Clarifying Goals

1. What are the long-term objectives for extending the simulator beyond the basic lift scenario? - not sure. want to start building with basically just lift(s) and implement various distributions to model different timing. 
2. Is the current architecture flexible enough to support multiple lifts or more complex agent behavior? - idk, that is kinda your department. should be able to support multiple lifts... I would imagine? idk. 

## Implementation Details

3. Are there preferred patterns for handling event scheduling and logging that we should standardize? - would just like to standardize a pattern 
4. What performance characteristics are most critical to measure as we expand functionality? - really, biggest thing is intrepretability and clarity. codex is writing nice code and it seems to be working; but the biggest friction I have is that I don't really, like, know what the agents are doing. that is why I've been adding logging features etc. 
5. Are there any integrations (e.g., with external data sources) planned for future development? - nothing planned. doesn't seem very likely.
