Prompt for Codex

Develop the Simulation class located in zero_liftsim/main.py. It currently contains only a placeholder with a descriptive docstring that explains its planned responsibilities. The overall design is an event‑driven simulator where agents interact with a single lift. Key details are recorded in NOTES-implementation.md:

The system is an agent-based discrete event simulation built around a priority queue of events, with a single lift and a global simulation clock.

Simulation is the core engine holding the clock and event queue. Events drive all state changes.

Best practices from the “Law Simulation” notes emphasize deterministic priority queue ordering and a single time field in Simulation.

Implementation Objectives
Core Structure

Maintain current_time and a monotonically increasing counter for tie-breaking events with the same timestamp.

Use heapq for the priority queue storing (timestamp, counter, event) tuples.

Provide a schedule(event, time) method that inserts events into the queue with the correct timestamp and counter.

Implement a run() method that repeatedly pops the next event, advances current_time, executes the event, and inserts any new events returned by the event’s execute() method until the queue is empty or a user‑defined stop condition is met.

Documentation

Keep a clear module‑level docstring and detailed docstrings for each public method, following the style in the existing skeleton.

Tests

Add unit tests under a new tests directory verifying basic functionality: events execute in timestamp order and tied events maintain the insertion order.

Run pytest after implementing the class (there are no tests yet, so creating them will allow the suite to pass).

Coding Practices

Follow the “Best Practices for Coding with Codex” guide in docs/best_practices_coding_with_codex.md—small, testable units, proper docstrings, and reviewing diffs before committing.

With these steps you will create a minimal but functional simulation engine to support the other classes.
