# Prompt for Codex prompt7 â€“ Follow-up to enhanced time tracking

Analyze the codebase and implement real datetime entries for all logged events. Currently the `Agent.log_event` method and `Logger.log` store an integer `time` representing simulation minutes. The new requirement is to convert these to timestamp strings starting from a configurable simulation start time.

## Requirements
- Add a `start_datetime` parameter to `Simulation.run` with default `datetime(2025, 3, 12, 9, 0, 0)`.
- Keep internal simulation times as integers but, whenever an event is logged, convert the minute offset to `start_datetime + timedelta(minutes=time)` and store the ISO formatted string in the log under `time`.
- `Agent.finish_ride` should also record `wait_time_readable` as `<wait_time> minutes` in the log.
- Update `Logger.log` and `Agent.log_event` signatures to accept both the numeric offset and the computed timestamp. All existing calls should pass the current simulation time and rely on these methods to format the timestamp.
- Allow callers of `run_alpha_sim` (and CLI) to optionally specify the start datetime and propagate it to `Simulation.run`.

## Tests
- Adjust tests to account for the new timestamp format. It is sufficient to verify that `Agent.activity_log` contains ISO formatted `time` strings and that `wait_time_readable` appears on `ride_complete` entries.
