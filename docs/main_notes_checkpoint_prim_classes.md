# Checkpoint - Primary Classes Implemented - pink-walk

#process-notes
This article (codename `pink-walk 44320cd6`) summarizes the progress made so far in the LiftSim project and outlines immediate next steps.

## Progress So Far

Development has followed a staged approach using focused prompts:

1. **Simulation Engine** – see [prompt0_dev_init_class.md](prompt0_dev_init_class.md). Implemented the `Simulation` class to manage a priority queue of events and advance the global clock.
2. **Lift Model** – see [prompt1_implement_lift.md](prompt1_implement_lift.md). Created the `Lift` class with a FIFO queue, capacity control, and state transitions between `idle` and `moving`.
3. **Event Hierarchy** – see [prompt2_event_classes.md](prompt2_event_classes.md). Added concrete `Event` subclasses (`ArrivalEvent`, `BoardingEvent`, `ReturnEvent`) to drive agent flow through the lift.
4. **Agent State Tracking** – see [prompt3_agent_class.md](prompt3_agent_class.md). Expanded `Agent` to record wait times and completed rides.

These classes now allow a basic discrete‑event cycle of agents arriving, boarding when the lift is idle, and the lift returning after its cycle time.

## Next Steps

The immediate goal is to run a very simple "alpha" simulation that exercises this cycle end‑to‑end. To verify agent behavior in detail, a **logging mode** will be added. This mode can capture per‑event information—such as queue length, cycle start/finish times, and each agent's wait time and ride count—even if it slows down large runs. Further down the road, more robust data logging and experiment tracking will be introduced so results can be analyzed or persisted.
