You're attempting to understand and evaluate the internal behavior of agents in a simulation largely developed by AI. To do that, you're designing a method that produces a human-readable summary of a specific agent's experience during a simulation run, identified by a UUID. Your goal is to illuminate what happened during that experience—step by step—so you can inspect, debug, and assess how well the simulation logic is functioning. Here's a clearer and more complete version of your original prompt:

---

Write a method on the `Agent` class that, given an `experience_id` (UUID), returns a formatted, human-readable string summarizing the agent's behavior during that experience. The purpose of this method is to support inspection and debugging of the simulation by clearly reporting what happened during a specific simulation run. This is especially important because much of the simulation was AI-generated and lacks well-documented logic, so this method serves as a reverse-engineering tool for understanding agent dynamics in practice.

The method should leverage existing codebase functionality to retrieve all relevant data linked to the provided `experience_id`, including events, decisions, state changes, and any notable outcomes. These should be presented in a descriptive narrative or bulleted list that includes timestamps and other important metadata where available.

Ideally, the implementation should use a Jinja2 template (or similar mechanism) to assemble the final string, which will make it easier to iterate on the presentation format. The method does not need to generate logs or files—just return the string so that it can be printed or inspected during development.

Key outcomes:

- Enables interpretable summaries of agent behavior for each experience
    
- Supports validation of simulation logic and stepwise correctness
    
- Aids in comparing actual agent behavior to expected behavior
    

This function should be simple to call during simulation review and modular enough that its underlying data extraction or formatting can be reused later for richer reporting or GUI displays.
