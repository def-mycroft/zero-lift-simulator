# Prompt for Codex prompt2 – Follow-up to "ruthless-ladder 3238db4e"

Implement the event classes in `zero_liftsim/main.py`. `Simulation` and `Lift` are already functioning; `Event`, `ArrivalEvent`, `BoardingEvent`, and `ReturnEvent` are currently only placeholders. Expand them so the simulator can run a basic cycle of arrival, boarding, and lift return.

## Base `Event`
- Define an abstract class with an `execute(simulation)` method.
- Document that subclasses must override `execute` and may return an iterable of `(event, time)` pairs to schedule additional events.

## `ArrivalEvent`
- Store references to an `Agent` and a `Lift`.
- `execute` should enqueue the agent on the lift.
- If the lift is idle when the agent arrives, schedule a `BoardingEvent` at the same timestamp.

## `BoardingEvent`
- Holds a reference to the `Lift`.
- When executed, call `lift.load()` to board waiting agents.
- If any agents board, schedule a `ReturnEvent` for `simulation.current_time + lift.cycle_time`.

## `ReturnEvent`
- Holds a reference to the `Lift`.
- When executed, call `lift.mark_idle()`.
- If the queue still contains agents, immediately schedule another `BoardingEvent`.

## Docstrings & Best Practices
- Provide clear docstrings for each class and method.
- Follow `docs/best_practices_coding_with_codex.md` for style and small, testable units.

## Tests
- Add unit tests covering an agent arriving, boarding, and the lift returning using the `Simulation` engine.
- Ensure the lift state transitions from `idle` → `moving` → `idle` and that events execute in order.
- Run `pytest` to confirm all tests pass before committing.
