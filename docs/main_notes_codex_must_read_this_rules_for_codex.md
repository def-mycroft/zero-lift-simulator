# Project Rules/Conventions for Codex

This document should help guide codex behavior, i.e. "codex, will you please
read this and follow as you're editing this codebase". 

these rules/conventions aren't necessarily comprehensive, i.e. there might be
others out there, but if it is in here then it is certainly important.  

# Rules

## Follow the Markdown Style Guide 

follow the "Markdown Documentation Style Guide" in "docs/", whenever writing a
markdown document there. 

## Follow the Docstring Style Guide

This guide is present in "docs/" and should be used when editing docstrings. 

## Class/Method edit -> Docstring Update

If something is changed about a method or class, the docstring should prob be
updated to reflect this.  

## Pay special attention to "for codex"

if you see something here that uses the phrase "for codex", it is probably meant for you to read and adhere to. 

## follow the wiki article creation article 

be esp sure to follow instructions here: [[zero/999-chaotic/zero-liftsim-docs/wiki_article_creation_for_codex|wiki_article_creation_for_codex]]
