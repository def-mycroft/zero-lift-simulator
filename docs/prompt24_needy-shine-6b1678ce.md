note: this is redo of [[prompt23_nappy-shelter-969bdb49]], it didn't really work right so going to do more prompt crafting.

I have a CLI simulation project with a helpers.py file.

1. Implement a function in helpers.py that generates an integer random seed from a UUID string. The idea is that every time I give this UUID string, I will get the exact same seed integer, suitable to use with Python's random seed functions (random.seed, np.random.seed, torch.manual_seed, etc). The seed must be deterministic and based only on the UUID string.
    
2. Modify the codebase so that this seed is used to initialize all sources of randomness in the simulation. The goal is that the entire simulation will produce exactly the same results when run again with the same UUID string as seed source. The connection is 1:1: each UUID → one seed → reproducible simulation run. You can assume the simulation run will always be given a UUID string at start time.
    
3. Write a test file for pytest. In the test, run the simulation once with a given UUID. Collect about 30 examples of output, particularly data related to agents, such as agent.get_state(), agent_state variables, and other agent-related outputs. Then, re-run the simulation with the same UUID and assert that the same 30 data points are reproduced identically. The point of the test is to ensure the reproducibility works perfectly.
    

Notes: the test should be robust and pass when the reproducibility works, and fail if the simulation generates different results.

Please write the helpers function, show what needs to be modified in the codebase to connect the seed, and provide the pytest test. You can assume the codebase uses pytest already.

## documentation 

also, add a docs article "docs/tutorial prompt24 needy-shine 6b1678ce.md" which will show how to specify different UUID seeds st start or to just have a random one generated. make sure to show how to retain the simulation uuid seed and replicate the simulation and show how to run random sim and get the same one back.
