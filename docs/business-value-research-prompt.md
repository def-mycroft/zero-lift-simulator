# Research Prompt: Business-Relevant Leverage in Agent-Based Simulation

This research project investigates how LiftSim—an agent-based, event-driven simulation of skier-lift interactions—can be applied to generate decision-relevant insights in real-world operational contexts. The simulation models the microdynamics of skiers queuing, boarding, and cycling through lift infrastructure, and produces output logs suitable for downstream analysis. The goal of this research is to identify where such outputs intersect meaningfully with operational, financial, or strategic decisions—initially within the ski resort domain, but with full awareness of analogous use cases in logistics, entertainment, and transport infrastructure.

This research is part of a broader technical portfolio. It will be publicly viewable and may be of interest to business stakeholders evaluating simulation tools, data science leads assessing product sense, or operations professionals exploring ways to increase throughput, reduce bottlenecks, or justify capital decisions. The deliverable will be structured to support both technical interpretation and business relevance, and will avoid speculative or abstract theorizing in favor of directly actionable framing.

## Objective

Determine where LiftSim already produces usable business signal and what technical or analytical extensions would increase its value as a decision-support tool. The project will emphasize points of contact between simulation output and high-leverage operational KPIs, such as capacity utilization, queueing delays, and service timing. Research will focus on practical use cases that connect simulation metrics to business actions—pricing, staffing, infrastructure design, and strategic planning.

## Orientation

This work assumes the reader may be a resort operations leader, a technically literate COO, or an analyst working within an operations-heavy company—possibly in the ski industry, but not necessarily. A secondary audience includes hiring managers or collaborators evaluating the business potential of simulation-based analytics. The research should therefore demonstrate fluency across technical modeling, applied decision-making, and cross-domain analogy. It should not assume or require deep prior familiarity with simulation methods.

## Research Questions

1. What operational or financial decisions could LiftSim plausibly inform today, given its current implementation?
2. Which existing simulation outputs (e.g. time-in-queue, lift cycle timing, interarrival gaps, rider throughput) map most directly to business KPIs?
3. What data would be required to calibrate LiftSim for credible use in real-world planning or forecasting scenarios?
4. What simulation or logging extensions would significantly increase LiftSim’s business relevance (e.g. weather models, agent preference variation, cost modeling, pricing response)?
5. What transferable insights from analogous domains—theme parks, transit systems, logistics hubs—can inform LiftSim’s evolution and its practical utility?

## Research Tasks

* Analyze the LiftSim source code and `docs/` materials to identify its current modeling structure, event loop behavior, and logging logic.
* Catalog all metrics currently produced and assess which are natively interpretable in a business context.
* Review simulation-relevant literature from operations-heavy fields, emphasizing where discrete-event models have informed tactical or strategic decisions.
* Propose a short list of compelling business use cases, ideally grounded in plausible real-world settings.
* Rank proposed extensions by estimated impact on simulation interpretability and decision utility.
* Summarize cross-industry analogs where similar simulation models have produced measurable ROI or operational leverage.

## Output Expectations

* A 2–3 page report structured for clarity and rigor, appropriate for a reader with either technical or business background.
* A short ranked list of proposed feature or modeling extensions, with rationale grounded in business impact.
* A brief section on analogs from other industries, structured to surface design principles, not just domain similarity.
* Optional: visualizations, sample dashboards, or log excerpts that clarify how LiftSim outputs could be read as KPIs.

## Tone and Framing

The report should be written in a dry, precise, analytical tone. It should be visibly authored by someone fluent in both modeling systems and applied analytics but should not explicitly refer to the author. Any implied marketing should come solely from the coherence and relevance of the insights, not from promotional language. The writing should aim for clarity, conciseness, and transferability.

## Strategic Use

This research is not purely academic. It serves as a publicly visible demonstration of how a technical simulation can be positioned as a decision-support system. It may function as a portfolio artifact for evaluating candidates capable of simulation-aware product thinking, or as a conversation starter for applied analytics roles with operational depth. The document will live alongside the LiftSim codebase and is intended to withstand scrutiny from both engineering teams and operational strategists.
