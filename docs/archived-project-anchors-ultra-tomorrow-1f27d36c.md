# ðŸ§  Anchor: rename start_wait â€“ hanging-silly (5/5)

2025-06-15 12:07:59 -0600
func `Agent.start_wait` has poor naming. this should be named something more substantial and understandable, where can easily understand "okay agent has now entered the start of the line".
It has now been renamed to ``enter_queue``.
