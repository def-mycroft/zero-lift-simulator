# Unstructured Thoughts - abstract motivations of simulation

the follow is a voice memo from me:


Okay. Here's what I wanted to say. I'm going to start recording voice memos. I'm basically transcribing them and throwing them into this project. I'm looking at adding the date times to the agent class so that the agent log and actually output data of this project will be put into where the time dimension of the events will actually have a real time stamp. It's just going to default to March 12th, and then we can actually set the time and then manipulate a typical time stamp to analyze times between things that have happened. It just makes it more clear, but the point of this voice memo is that I wanted to mention that it's kind of a way of thinking about this project is that I'm probably going to end up using this to generate some data and almost treat that data as if it is the actual data. Part of the motivation for simulation research like this is to be able to measure things or approximate a measurement of something that you can't actually measure in reality. In theory, you could put a GPS tracking device on a customer who agrees to it, and you could do this with a sample, and that's totally possible, but reality is that that's going to be harder to actually do. I mean, you can scan to lift. You could look at lift ticket times and infer from there, but the simulation is just going to give you the option of measuring things in ways that you really couldn't feasibly do in reality. Another benefit of simulation is that this will allow us to do experiments. For instance, I have a hypothesis that basically variability in the amount of time it takes an agent to complete the run actually leads to more variability in wait times in the queue. So, if we start modeling out all these different probability distributions, like we model the probability distribution of how long it takes each agent to get down the slope, then this can actually lead to different kinds of – or it can lead to undesirable patterns in wait times, right? So, that's just like a thought, and it's unclear what – like, it's not immediately clear what the utility of that is, but it's just something that I'm curious about, and I'm just going to trust that my curiosity is useful here, that I'm kind of steeping myself in this project, and it's probably useful because I'm curious about it. It's a sign, it's a useful signal for that. But yeah, basically, like, I want to think about this simulation modeling, and then I'll probably end up using this simulation to generate data and then sort of analyze that data as if this were actually real data and compare it and be able to actually demonstrate, you know, things that I'm used to. They actually demonstrate techniques and methods that I could apply to learn things from this.
