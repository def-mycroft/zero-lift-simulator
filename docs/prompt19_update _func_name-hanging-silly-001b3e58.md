```python
    # """Record when the agent enters the queue."""
    def enter_queue(self, time: int, timestamp: str) -> None:
        """Record when the agent enters the queue."""

        self.wait_start = time
        self.log_event("start_wait", time, timestamp)
```

The original function name ``start_wait`` was unclear. It has been renamed to
``enter_queue`` so it's obvious the agent has entered the line.
