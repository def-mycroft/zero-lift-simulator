```python
    # """Record when the agent enters the queue."""
    # TODO - the name of this function should be different, it is 
    # too hard to infer what that means, would rather say 
    # "entered queue"
    def start_wait(self, time: int, timestamp: str) -> None:
        """Record when the agent enters the queue."""

        self.wait_start = time
        self.log_event("start_wait", time, timestamp)

```


func `Agent.start_wait` has poor naming. this should be named something more substantial and understandable, where can easily understand "okay agent has now entered the start of the line".
