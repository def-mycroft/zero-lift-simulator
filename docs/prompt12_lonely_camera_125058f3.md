Implement a function named `visualize_states(agent_exp_log_data: dict, time: datetime, out_path: str = "state_diagram.png") -> None` in Python. This function generates a static visualization of a simulation state machine diagram, using matplotlib to draw a minimalistic diagram showing where each agent is at a particular moment in time. It should render and save a PNG to `out_path`.

Assume `agent_exp_log_data` is a dictionary containing two pandas DataFrames: `'exp_rideloop'` and `'agent_log'`. Both DataFrames have a `time` column (already parsed as datetime), and `'agent_log'` has at minimum the columns `agent_id`, `event`, and `time`. Events represent agent state transitions and include values like `'start_wait'`, `'board'`, `'ride'`, `'exit'`, and `'return'`.

Use a fixed layout for the diagram: define the x-y positions of each state node in a dictionary like

```python
state_positions = {
    "start_wait": (0, 0),
    "board": (1, 1),
    "ride": (2, 0),
    "exit": (3, 1),
    "return": (4, 0),
}
```

At the specified `time`, iterate through the `agent_log` DataFrame and extract the most recent event for each `agent_id` that occurred at or before that timestamp. If the event name matches one of the defined states in `state_positions`, render a small square at that state’s x-y position with the agent ID printed on it.

In addition to agent boxes, render each state as a labeled node using a gray circle. Suppress axes, set a reasonable figure size (e.g., 10x4 inches), and use simple matplotlib primitives—circles for state nodes, rectangles for agents. Save the output to the PNG file path given by `out_path`.

Do not render transitions or arrows between states—just static positions of current agents in their states. Make the diagram readable even when there are many agents by scaling fonts appropriately.

The goal is to generate a single visual “frame” that can later be used to animate or analyze the evolution of agent states over time.

the aesthetic should be squarish, looking like something from "game of life". minimalist , black/white.
