# Prompt for Codex prompt4 â€“ Follow-up to "wandering-marmot 3897c21d" 

Implement the first end-to-end "alpha" simulation and create a minimal logging utility. The core classes (`Simulation`, `Lift`, `Agent`, and the event subclasses) are already in place.



## Alpha Simulation
- Add a function `run_alpha_sim(n_agents: int, lift_capacity: int, cycle_time: int) -> dict` in `zero_liftsim/main.py`.
- Generate `n_agents` with sequential arrival times starting at 0 (one agent per minute) and schedule `ArrivalEvent`s for them.
- Instantiate a `Lift` with the provided capacity and cycle time.
- Run the `Simulation` until no events remain.
- Return summary metrics such as total rides completed and average wait time.

## Logging Kernel

note: "kernel" here is meant to indicate that the idea is that this could become a larger logging utility. observe that there is a new directory called `logs`, this is where the primary log file will be written to. it won't be version-controlled as of now, i.e. logs won't be. 

- Create a module `zero_liftsim/logging.py` containing a simple `Logger` class.
- `Logger.log(event_name, time, **info)` should append a dictionary to an internal list.
- Provide a `records()` method returning the list of log entries.
- Update `Simulation.run` to accept an optional `logger` parameter. When supplied, call `logger.log` before executing each event with the event's class name, timestamp, and queue length.

## Tests
- Verify `run_alpha_sim` processes all agents and reports reasonable metrics.
- Verify that logging captures the expected event sequence when a logger is passed.
- Follow `docs/best_practices_coding_with_codex.md` and run `pytest` before committing.

## documentation 


after the above, write a documentation article in `docs/` which describes how to run the alpha sim and to understand what is being logged and retrieve some basic simulation data. this example needs to be something that runs very quickly, ideally seconds. just big enough to be functional.
