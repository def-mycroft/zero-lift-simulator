# Best Practices for Coding with Codex

Follow these guidelines when working with Codex or other LLM-based tools:

1. **Understand the context.** Read existing docs and comments to ensure new code fits the project.
2. **Prefer small, testable units of code.** Break functionality into functions or classes with clear responsibilities.
3. **Document your changes.** Include docstrings and update relevant documentation when adding features.
4. **Run existing tests.** Execute the repository's test suite after making changes.
5. **Review diffs before committing.** Ensure the generated code does what you intend and remove any unnecessary or unrelated changes.
