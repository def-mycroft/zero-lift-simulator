# Prompt

The simulation engine uses a discrete-event architecture where time advances based on scheduled events. Each event occurs at a specific timestamp, and durations (e.g., lift ride time) are **not sampled and then used to determine event times**, but rather durations are inferred from pre-scheduled events.

To integrate lift-specific, per-agent time costs using sampled distributions while preserving this architecture, Codex will need to shift part of the event scheduling logic so that **durations are sampled first**, and **event timestamps are computed accordingly**. This will also support agent-specific, per-loop variation in timings.

Here is the Codex prompt to implement this system:

**Codex Prompt: Implement AgentRideLoopExperience with Lift-Specific Time Cost Sampling**

We are upgrading our LiftSim engine to track agent-level ride loop experiences across multiple lifts, where time costs for lift riding, skiing, and queueing vary by lift and agent. This allows us to generate variable per-agent timelines and log durations for downstream analysis.

**Architecture Overview**

The simulation uses a discrete-event architecture with a global clock and priority event queue. Each agent repeatedly loops through:

* Boarding and riding a lift
* Skiing down
* Returning and queuing

We want to track each loop’s time components via an `AgentRideLoopExperience` class, and shift event scheduling to support **duration-driven simulation**, where time cost distributions are sampled to determine *when* an event occurs.

**Step-by-Step Tasks**

1. **Agent Refactor**

   * Move `Agent` class from `main.py` into a new `zero_liftsim/agent.py`.
   * Give each `Agent` an attribute `rideloop: AgentRideLoopExperience`.

2. **Experience Classes**

   * Create `zero_liftsim/experience.py` with the following:

```python
class AgentExperience:
    def __init__(self):
        self.log = {}

class AgentRideLoopExperience(AgentExperience):
    def add_entry(self, dt: datetime, ride: float, traverse: float, queue: float):
        self.log[dt] = {
            "time_cost_ride_lift": ride,
            "time_cost_traverse_down_mountain": traverse,
            "time_cost_in_queue": queue,
        }
```

3. **Lift Time Sampling**

   * In `zero_liftsim/main.py` (or refactor to `lift.py`), add to `Lift`:

```python
from random import gauss

class Lift:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.ride_mean = 7
        self.ride_sd = 1
        self.traverse_mean = 5
        self.traverse_sd = 1.5

    def time_cost_ride_lift(self) -> float:
        return max(1, gauss(self.ride_mean, self.ride_sd))

    def time_cost_traverse_down_mountain(self) -> float:
        return max(1, gauss(self.traverse_mean, self.traverse_sd))
```

4. **Event Scheduling Refactor**

   * When the agent **boards** a lift:

     * Call `lift.time_cost_ride_lift()` to sample the ride duration.
     * Schedule the `ride_complete` event at `current_time + duration`.

   * When `ride_complete` executes:

     * Call `lift.time_cost_traverse_down_mountain()` to sample ski time.
     * Schedule `return_to_queue` event at `current_time + duration`.

   * After `return_to_queue`:

     * Call a function in `AgentRideLoopExperience` to log this loop:

       * Include sampled ride and traverse times
       * Include queue duration inferred from `arrival - start_wait` events

5. **Logging Integration**

   * Add to `Agent.activity_log` a way to correlate timestamps with sampled durations.
0
   * Use the simulation clock’s datetime (`start_datetime + timedelta(minutes=current_time)`) as the key when calling `add_entry()` on the experience class.
   * note: put another way, there should globally only be one time. events happen at times generated by AgentExperience

6. **Documentation**

   * Create `docs/agent-experience.md`:

     * Explain what `AgentExperience` is
     * Clarify how durations are sampled and logged
     * Show example log entry

**Example Logged Entry**

```json
{
  "2025-03-12T09:15:00": {
    "time_cost_ride_lift": 7.2,
    "time_cost_traverse_down_mountain": 5.1,
    "time_cost_in_queue": 4.6
  }
}
```

**Notes**

* Queue duration is not sampled—it’s inferred from existing simulation events (`arrival` minus `start_wait`).
* This setup is agent-specific: each loop gets its own sampled durations, enabling high-resolution downstream analysis.
* also, each loop is different, like "I was queued for 4.6 minutes at first then I was queued for 5.4 minutes next time". 

Proceed with this as a major simulation capability upgrade. Let me know if you'd like stub files generated.


# Raw Voice Memo Transcript

The below is a transcribed voice memo that was used in the process of updating this. 


This is just a voicemail for my zero LIFSIM project and trying to develop a prompt for codecs to update this project. Basically, what I'm thinking about is, I'm going to update this to include three LIFS. Right now it only has two LIFS. When I was thinking about how to implement two LIFS, we have the problem of, thinking about making this realistic, how do we get from having, let's see, how do I put it? If we're trying to make this realistic, and if we have just one LIST, or one LIFT rather, agents can, agents can go ride after they get off the LIFT. Right? So they're on LIFT1, and then we have the exit LIFT event. And then they go and ride, and then they get off the LIFT, and then they go and ride. After riding, they go and, they go and get into the line, after riding, of course, and then they wait in line. They wait in line, or wait in the queue, and ride the LIFT, and then they exit the LIFT. And really, this is mostly about events, but, so what's, so we have all these different processes that we're simulating, including riding the LIFT, so we have a lot of different processes that are being simulated, and each one of these processes has a time cost associated with it. And I want to be able to model the, model different distributions of those times, because part of what we're trying to do with this project is to be able to simulate reality, and then be able to tweak things around in the simulation to test hypotheses and get some insight about the, you know, about operations. So, but for each of these, these things that happen, like, like, there's a, there's a time line. Another way to think of it is there is a time line for the agent, you know, the agent starts at the bottom of the LIFT, and the agent returns back to the bottom of the LIFT after riding, and it takes some time for the agent to get to the LIFT, and it takes some time for, it takes some time to get agent to get to the LIFT. It takes some time for them to ride. No, no, start, start, starting over. So, we have the agent timeline is, the agent starts, well, let's say the agent starts by, the agent starts the cycle at boarding the LIFT. So, he's gotten through the queue on the LIFT. After you board the LIFT, there's an event. You board the LIFT, you ride the LIFT, and there's events of exiting the LIFT. Then you ride, ski, and then back to the LIFT. So, we want to model these three different times here, right, for the agent. So, for the agent, we have a time distribution for how long it takes to ride the LIFT. So, we're going to assume x minutes, and then we're going to assume a distribution around that. And then also, we have this sort of time segment of riding, which is another one where we want to model a probability distribution there. And we also have the last segment, which is after you're done riding, you're getting back to the LIFT, which might mean walking on a trail, or getting to the queue, I guess, getting in queue. Right. But that's just one simple way of getting the data that we need here, and sort of organizing the data from the simulation is this agent ride loop concept, which is worth talking about. But what I'm getting at is, for any loop like this, or any activity, we can take, maybe we call it like an agent experience or something, where an agent experience has your, you know, it's a timeline, and it's broken into different segments. And for each of these agent experience time segments, we want to model the probability of, we want to statistically model how long this takes, right? So, every time an agent exits the LIFT, we add, we record how long this took. And we choose how long it took by drawing from a probability distribution that we decide to model. So, I say, like, this is just, you know, just for just starting out here, just trying to get a simple thing up and running, I can just plug in a standard normal distribution with some, you know, center and some dispersion. And then every time the agent exits the LIFT and, quote, unquote, rides, a certain amount of time has passed, right? So, that's interesting. But yeah, so, what I need, though, is I need to implement a way of sort of keeping track of the of these probability distributions. And it's sort of a huge, you know, because there's going to be lots of them. Like, I imagine this project could turn into, you know, simulating, like, an entire season. Like, imagine running a simulation that goes from September through April. And this simulation goes from, you know, so we're simulating a day. And we're, so with that, and we're getting really realistic here, we're simulating so many different probability distributions that we need a way of organizing it. So, I think one way to organize this is this agent experience concept, because this is all very ground up. Like, we're not doing anything macro here. We're really trying to get each, we're trying to model individual agent behavior by digging down into the, digging into the individual agents. I'm just trying to figure out how to organize that and do it in a way that is, you know, that is easy to modify and understand. So, I don't know. I had a thought that maybe this is a, that maybe there's an agent experience class that we take and we make a base agent experience class. And this class is something that we could have based class. And then we can create instances of that class or subclass it to make, to this agent experience. So, this agent experience, and then we subclass it to make agent, you know, ride loop experience. And agent ride loop experience is where we'll actually, you know, program in these different factors related to the agent experience. The agent experience. Because it's not necessarily about time either. I could imagine, you know, right now I'm thinking about drawing from probability distributions to sort of add up what happened. It's to add up how long this takes, but I could imagine doing something like, I don't know, like something Sully would be like, or something like what if, how many times did the agent experience a queue time that was longer than, you know, a certain threshold and just actually log that in the simulation directly. So, that's the task is we need to implement. So, let's just go that route. So, we have the agent experience class, and it's a base class for an experience. And then the agent, and then we'll subclass this for different kinds of experiences that we're sort of monitoring. So, we'll subclass agent experience into agent ride experience, agent ride loop experience. And then an agent ride loop experience, we have, this is a method, or this class has methods, which allow us to generate these times, and it also tracks the data. So, when we run the simulation, we'll be able to look at an individual agent, and the agent will have an attribute ride loop experience. And that will be one of these agent experience classes. And in ride loop experience, we'll be able to see what, we'll be able to see a record of these experiences. So, it's a dictionary that's attached to this agent experience class, which has keys for the temporal order. Now, let's say that probably the keys of the agent experience log on that agent experience class is the date times, where each date time corresponds to the start of this experience segment. And then we have more data on the actual experience. So, like, what was the name of the experience segment? Was it the ride or the lift? And what was the duration of it? And, but we'll have to modify the code somewhere. I'm not sure where, but the code will have to be modified to actually interact with this. So, when an event happens, we need to interact with this agent experience class to generate a time, or some other piece of data, and then add that experience to the agent experience log on the agent experience class. This way, this is useful as a way to talk about it. This is useful as a way to talk about it. And this is useful as a way to understand it myself, as well as convey it to other people, and to sort of roll this up. So, in the future, we'll be able to access these agent experience logs, and then build a database from that, and be able to answer questions like, what was the, you know, typical time spent in the queue, or something like that? Okay.
