# Project Questions

This article lists open questions about the project to clarify next steps and ensure alignment with overall goals.

## Clarifying Goals

1. What are the long-term objectives for extending the simulator beyond the basic lift scenario?
2. Is the current architecture flexible enough to support multiple lifts or more complex agent behavior?

## Implementation Details

3. Are there preferred patterns for handling event scheduling and logging that we should standardize?
4. What performance characteristics are most critical to measure as we expand functionality?
5. Are there any integrations (e.g., with external data sources) planned for future development?

Please provide any additional guidance or documentation that addresses these questions.
