# Zero Utilities

This repository started as a lift simulation prototype. The simulation code remains, but the focus has shifted to reusable utilities and documentation that can support a variety of small projects. The `zero-liftsim` command line tool provides a simple entry point for running helpers such as documentation maintenance commands.
