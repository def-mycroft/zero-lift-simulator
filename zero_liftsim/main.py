"""Core library for Zero Lift Simulator."""

"""
One-lift simulation kernel scaffold.
This module defines the foundational class structure for an agent-based
simulation of skier-lift interaction at a ski resort. Each class is a placeholder
with a development-oriented docstring describing its intended role and expansion path.
"""

class Simulation:
    """Simulation engine that manages global time and the event queue.

    This class holds the central event loop for the simulation. It maintains a
    priority queue of scheduled events (sorted by timestamp), the current clock
    time, and a counter for tie-breaking identical event times.

    It is responsible for:
    - Popping the next scheduled event.
    - Advancing the clock.
    - Executing the event logic.
    - Inserting any new events back into the queue.

    It knows nothing about the semantics of agents or lifts—only about time
    and event execution order.

class Event:
    """Abstract base class for all simulation events.

    Each event represents a time-stamped occurrence that alters the state of
    the system. Subclasses must implement an `execute(simulation)` method.

    Events are scheduled into the simulation engine and executed in
    time order. They may include:
    - Arrival of an agent
    - Boarding process starting
    - Lift returning
    - Any other discrete action tied to a specific time

    This abstraction allows easy insertion of new behaviors without
    modifying the simulation core.

class Agent:
    """Represents a skier agent with individual traits and state.

    Each agent is uniquely identified and possesses traits like:
    - arrival time
    - time they began waiting in line
    - whether they’ve boarded the lift

    In future expansions, agents may include:
    - skill level
    - tolerance for waiting
    - time-of-day preferences
    - probability-based decision rules for breaks or early departure

    The agent holds only state and identity—it does not schedule or process events.

class Lift:
    """Represents a single ski lift with queue and transport behavior.

    This class tracks:
    - queue of waiting agents
    - lift capacity
    - loading and return cycle times
    - operational state (idle, moving)

    Lift objects are passive and stateless in time—they are modified by events
    like BoardingEvent and ReturnEvent. Lift does not manage its own timing or
    schedule events, but it provides accessors and mutators for its state and queue.

    Future lift logic may include:
    - weather-induced delays
    - terrain-based capacity limits
    - interdependencies with other lifts

    This event is scheduled at the agent’s designated arrival time. When executed:
    - Adds the agent to the lift queue
    - If the lift is idle, schedules a BoardingEvent

    their presence in the simulation timeline.

    - Transfers agents from the queue into the lift (up to capacity)
    - Marks those agents as boarded
    - Schedules a ReturnEvent based on lift cycle time
    - Marks the lift state as 'moving'

    This abstracts all loading logic and gatekeeping.

    Executed after the lift has completed its cycle. On execution:
    - Marks the lift state as idle
    - If there are still agents waiting, schedules the next BoardingEvent
